  This is inspired by an article by Gergely Orosz titled ['An Educational Side
  Project,'](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/an-educational-side-project/?fbclid=IwAR0rf7BB9jZ2J9goLWGaXVae60Yi84ETBebXKVIbmaoQg5eCpxPTo1TZaLk)
  where he introduced a really innovative project idea. I'm going to attempt to
  build it out and document my progress here.

Until now, I've been doing small projects as a mean to learn new technology and concepts. The method served me well in my endeavour and I've learned a lot.
However, I've always felt that I'm missing something. I've never had the chance to work on a project that is big enough to have a full picture of the whole system.

After reading an article on a very cool side project, I've found the perfect opportunity to build something similar and,
simultaneously, learn Go, a language I've been wanting to try for a long time.

## The idea

TThe objective is to create a system capable of simulating the entire process of a food delivery service like DoorDash
or UberEat, from the moment a customer orders food to its delivery. Additionally, a frontend is needed to visualize the
system in action. I'll adapt the map concept from the article above with some modifications.

## Design

There should be main Go backend services to manage all the logic, and a smaller client will act as fake shippers,
customers, and restaurants to place, accept, and deliver orders. The frontend, written in React, is not for customer or
restaurant interactions but merely for visualizing the system.

I aim to build everything using standard libraries in Go and will attempt to avoid third-party libraries as much as
possible. Learning is the primary goal here, so time is not a significant concern.
