At the beginning of any project, I usually set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Based on my personal experience, this process often takes longer than expected.

## Project setup

I'll use a monorepo approach to kick off the project. There's no specific reason for choosing a monorepo; it's just that this project will likely be small, and I don't want the hassle of switching repositories during development.

Firstly, I'll code a basic HTTP server in Go:

```go
// main.go
func main() {
  // Setup server
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello world, it's restaurant service")
	})
	server := &http.Server{Addr: ":8080"}

	go func() {
		log.Println("Starting RESTAURANT server on port 8080")

		err := server.ListenAndServe()
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error starting RESTAURANT server: %s\n", err)
			os.Exit(1)
		}
	}()

	// Trap sigterm or interrupt and gracefully shutdown the server
	c := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt, os.Kill)

	// Block until a signal is received.
	sig := <-c
	log.Printf("Got signal: %s, exiting.", sig)

	// Gracefully shutdown the server
	ctx, _ := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
	server.Shutdown(ctx)
}
```

Copying this 3 more times, and we have a neat microserves :). After that, there should be a separate Dockerfile for each server.
Then, I can use a docker-compose.yml to get them running. The directory structure would probably look like this:

```txt
├── delivery
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── main.go
├── order
│   └── ... (same as above)
├── user
│   └── ... (same as above)
├── restaurant
│   └── ... (same as above)
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── go.work
```

This is easy little work. The real challenge is deploying this setup automatically whenever there are new changes.

## Deployment

The setup above comes from my plan to deploy everything onto a single VM. That's why it's beneficial to have them all in one repository. It also makes it convenient to use a single GitHub Action to deploy them all.
I still have some AWS credits left from my "Startup-Founder-Wannabe" phase, so I'm going to utilize those. I'll quickly set up a `t2.micro` server, configure the DNS for [delivery.baotong.dev](delivery.baotong.dev) to point to that EC2, install Docker on it, and we're good to go.

Now, I need to create a GitHub Action for deployment. I had a tough time getting this to work.

I first attempted to SSH into the EC2 instance, copy the code over, and run the `docker compose up` command. This approach didn't work out because while copying, it would replace the new files without deleting the old ones.

Next, I tried using rsync, then building the images on the instance and running `compose up`. This method didn't work either. I faced some connectivity issues when it took too long, and for some reason, it lasted over 15 minutes per action run.

And finally, with a bit of googling and chatGPTing, I decided to build the images using GitHub Actions, push them to a public registry, rsync the compose file to the EC2, and then pull and run them there. This worked flawlessly.

```yml
// .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
name: Deploy to EC2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Push to EC2 Instance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build docker images
        run: |
          docker compose build
          docker compose push

      - name: Deploy to my EC2 instance
        uses: easingthemes/ssh-deploy@v4
        env:
          SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          SOURCE: "./"
          REMOTE_HOST: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          REMOTE_USER: ubuntu
          TARGET: "/home/ubuntu/food-delivery"
          SCRIPT_BEFORE: ls
          SCRIPT_AFTER: |
            docker compose -f "./food-delivery/docker-compose.yaml" pull
            docker compose -f "./food-delivery/docker-compose.yaml" up -d
```

This resulted in an efficient workflow where any changes to the main branch would automatically update and run the latest version on the server.
My next steps are to route the services through nginx and establish a testing pipeline.
