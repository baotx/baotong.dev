While learning Go, I discovered an incredible hot reload package for Go development.
Today, I want to set it up with a Dockerfile. The goal is to make it easy for anyone,
whether it's a new machine or a collaborator joining the development,
to start working with minimal setup requirements. All they need is **Docker**.

To achieve this, they can simply set up a `docker-compose.override.yaml` file by copying the
`docker-compose.development.yaml` configuration, run the Docker Compose, and voil√†!
They can start tinkering with the code without worrying about dependencies and other hassles.

## The updated dockerfile

The updated dockerfile looks like this. I added a development stage,
in it we only need to use `cosmtrek/air` docker image and that's it.

```dockerfile
# --- Build Stage ---
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY go.mod ./
RUN go mod download

COPY *.go ./

RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o /user

# --- Development Stage ---
FROM cosmtrek/air AS development

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["air"]

# --- Final Stage ---
FROM alpine:latest

COPY --from=builder /user /user

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/user"]
```

I've been loving this setup, it took a while but I can forget about the deployment for awhile. Now let the coding begin
